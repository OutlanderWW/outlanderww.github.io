Welcome to the world of chaos known as Nahusheim. A crossroads between worlds of sorts where
tears in reality are considered much too common for its inhabitants good. Not only tears but in
extreme cases whole areas disappear and are replaced by another clearly out of place. This
phenomenon known to the nahusmians as displacement. Many of the known leylines of powers from
common ones such as the arcane, divine, demonic through light and the druidic to much rarer ones:
the psionic, void and other paracausal sources coexist within Nahusheim. Much of this realmâ€™s
history is still unknown. It is split into 5 continents and 4 oceans.
